## Using machine learning models to cluster myopic patients

### Purpose:
Myopia or nearsightedness is a common occular medical condition that is estimated to affect 30% of the current world population, with projections that amount to 50% of the world or nearly 5 billion myopic patients by 2050. (Holden et al. 2016) Symptoms of myopia may present differently for patients in terms of severity etc., but the its rapidly growing rate of prevalence and potentials for further degeneration and loss of vision among patients have alarmed researchers world-wide. 

The purpose of this project was to sample and explore distinct groups of patients, to find possible clusters of features that could contribute to predicting cases of myopia.

### Summary:
After applying dimensionality reduction to the patient dataset using principal component analysis (PCA) and t-SNE, the reduced data was used to fit a K-means clustering model to classify groups within the sample population. The resulting visualisation suggests that patients and their prevalent features can be classified into three distinct clusters.
